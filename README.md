Simple YARA rule generator using machine learning
Worldwide, malware poses a constant and expanding threat to computer systems and networks. Malware assaults
have the potential to seriously harm systems and networks, causing considerable financial losses and harm to oneâ€™s reputation.
Therefore, malware identification is essential for reducing the
hazards brought on by these attacks.
Security experts may discover and recognize harmful code
with the help of the YARA rule generator, a crucial tool in
malware detection. The significance of the YARA rule generator
for malware detection is discussed in this article, along with how
it can assist in shielding your computer systems and networks
from malware assaults. I have developed a tool that can generate
YARA rules given a set of malware samples. These generated
rules could further be used to identify and successfully detect
similar malware.
